RULES
- You are presented with a cube.

  that are made entirely of hollow chunks.

  on the side of the cube for each row.
- The number of remaining columns is indicated
  on the top left of the screen.
- You must guess which columns are completely
  hollow and click on them.
- When all columns have been found,
  you get points based on the diffculty level
  and a new cube is created.

POINTS
